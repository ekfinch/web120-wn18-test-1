<p>Parallax [par-uh-laks] noun; the apparent displacement of an observed object due to a change in the position of the observer.</p>  

<p>How does this pertain to styling, and web design? Parallax scrolling is a hugely popular way to design websites. It creates the illusion of depth, and provides an interactive experience for the user through clever design.</p>   

<p>According to the Editorial Team at 1stwebdesigner.com, “Parallax has existed since the 1980’s and was used in video game titles and later was used on websites. Today, it is one of the most widely-used designs on the modern Web. There hasn’t been a design style that has captured the web’s creative community like that of parallax website design in ages, which, in non-industry terms, is about a few months. (Editorial Team)”</p>  

<p>The use of parallax design is truly only limited by the creativity of the designer. According to the Editorial Team at 1stwebdesigner.com, “There are 4 widely understood, and simple ways to incorporate parallax into your design. One is called The Layer Method. It uses multiple backgrounds that can move independently horizontally or vertically, depending on your preference, and can be composited on one another.</p> 

<p>Another method is The Sprite Method – It uses one big image comprised of multiple images that display only part of that said image when at different positions. Commonly used in navigation menus. The Repeating Pattern Method is another way to use parallax – It involves scrolling displays built up of individual tiles can be made to float over a repeating background layer.</p>   
<p>And finally, The Raster Method – It uses lines of pixels in an image, and are typically composited, and refreshed in top-to-bottom order with a slight delay between drawing one line to the next line. (Editorial Team)”</p> 
<p>Parallax is definitely a slick, and eye catching way to design a website. However, we shouldn’t overlook the fact that there are some disadvantages to using Parallax.  According to IQ Computing, “Users with motion sickness may become unsettled. Users that are not as tech savvy may see parallax web design as overly complicated and frustrating to find information.  And older browsers may have a difficulty rendering parallax design and scrolling. (IQ Computing)”</p> 
<p>If you take the possible disadvantages of using Parallax with a grain of salt, you can find inspiration all across the Web. There are a plethora of advanced Parallax web design examples out there that will knock your socks off. It really can be another impressive tool in your web design/development toolbox.</p>
