<p>The Flexible Box Module, or flexbox as it is more commonly known, was designed to be a one-dimensional layout model. It is also a method that offers space distribution between items in an interface, and powerful alignment capabilities.</p>
<p>It offers an alternative to floats for defining the overall appearance of a web page. Floats are frustratingly limited as they will only let us horizontally position our boxes. Flexbox, on the other hand, gives us absolute control over the alignment, direction, order, and size of our boxes.</p>
<p>Before Flexbox came into play, floats were the sole option for laying out a complex web page. As a result, they’re well supported in most browsers, and developers have used them to build millions of web pages.
<p>According to Oliver James at internetingishard.com, “Floats were originally intended for magazine-style layouts. The kinds of layouts you can create with floats are actually somewhat limited. Even a simple sidebar layout is, technically speaking, a little bit of a hack. Flexbox was invented to break out of these limitations. (James)”</p>
<p>We are now at a point where browser support is wide, and people are discovering the advantages of using flexbox.  Developers can start building full websites with flexbox, without the fear of not being supported.</p>  
<p>According to Chris David Mills at the Mozilla Developer Network, “Why Flexbox? For a long time, the only reliable cross browser-compatible tools available for creating CSS layouts were things like floats and positioning. These are fine and they work, but in some ways they are also rather limiting and frustrating. (Mills)”</p>
<p>Flexbox is an exciting, and ambitious development. It offers a variety of new features that help us break free of the limits of the float. Flexbox provides another step forward for the layout of modern Web pages, and applications. It will be fascinating to see how The Flexbox Model develops. As well as how this will impact page layouts, and other revelations that await the future of Web Design.</p>
