    <p>There are several things about designing a website for a client or yourself that you want to consider. How do you want to present your website to the world? What kind of audience to you want to reach? How do you want to maximize the user experience? You have a couple options that will help you decide: Responsive Web Design or Native Design.</p> 

    <p>Responsive Web Design is designed to respond to the user. No matter the screen size, orientation or device, Responsive Design should always provide the user with the best possible experience.</p> 

    <p>Native Design, on the other hand, has been designed for a specific device, using language for that device alone. An app written for an iPhone for example would not work on an Android. The designers would have to write a separate language for the Android for the app to work.</p> 

    <p>There was a time when Responsive Web Design was enough, and worked for most situations. But over the years with the explosion of Mobile devices on the market, and people’s desire to use them over traditional desktops, Native Design is more prevalent. According to Bhavana Singh of Infojini Consulting, “The trend of smartphones and tablets is continuously evolving, followed by a regular release of new OS versions and a wide variety of mobile apps. High-speed internet connections have transformed the way consumers use smartphones. Since businesses and brands cannot afford to lag behind, the need to create app and adapt to mobile devices is all-pervasive. (Singh)” 

    <p>When we look at the difference between Responsive and Native Design, the major difference is time and money. Responsive Design takes a lot less time to create. It’s also a fraction of the cost vs designing a mobile app. Responsive Web Design also automatically adapts to any platform, screen size or orientation.</p> 

    <p>According to Sawyer Bateman of UX Magazine, “The most salient tension today is between function and form. This wasn't always the case, as responsive and native apps used to be quite similar in terms of functionality. Another way to look at the tension is in terms of costs and investment in development. As with function and form, the differences here used to be minimal. But as the mobile ecosystem has evolved—specifically native apps—the differences have grown. (Bateman)”</p> 


    <p>There are some big advantages to Native Design however. Native Design is easier to use, and performs quicker. It is also fully integrated & flexible. Also, once it is downloaded from the app store and installed on the user’s device, it doesn’t need an internet connection to run and display content. These are definitely things to consider as a web designer, and when working with clients. Especially if you want to reach as large of an audience as possible.</p>
