When adding a shopping cart to your site, or your client’s site, there are a few things you must consider.

These companies can provide everything you need to set up your shopping cart, and begin processing orders.</p>

You will want to keep it simple so you don’t lose any potential customers. According to Catalin Zorzini at ecommerceplatforms.com, “If you are a novice online store owner, then there is really nothing as important as ease of use.
