<p>How does the old saying go? A picture is worth a thousand words. Well, if one picture is worth a thousand words, how much are a gallery of images worth? And more importantly, how much value does adding a gallery to you or your client’s website bring? Images capture people’s attention. With all of the information that is available these days, and the limitless websites that exist, it is vital to stand out of the crowd. Having a gallery on a website can really capture that attention. Especially if it is responsive, and user friendly.</p>

<p>According to Sarah Smith at nimble.com, “Familiarizing customers with your products has numerous benefits. It can allow them to understand your product’s quality, to know more about your company, and even to solve some problems that would require a call to your customer support hotline. That’s where a photo gallery can become indispensable for putting your physical products right in front of your customers’ eyes. (Smith)”</p>

<p>A great tool that can showcase your gallery is an image slider. A slider is essentially a slideshow where two or more images scroll, and can feature text, and possibly a call to action. A slider can benefit a website in a number of ways. It makes a serious visual impact without making a user scroll down through a gallery.

<p>A slider holds the users attention.  It’s a good bet that they’re going to hang around to see all of the slides. This adds to how long a user is on the site. This, in turn, affects seo.  When a user stays on your site longer it indicates to search engines that the site is engaging. A slider can also provide you with the opportunity to produce multiple call to actions (CTA’s) above the fold (that way the user won’t have to scroll down to see it).</p>

<p>According to Gavin at codegeekz.com, “jQuery Mobile Sliders allow users to display images and content in elegant ways on your mobile device with improved touch gesture for delivering better user experience. (Gavin)”</p>

<p>We must keep responsive layout in mind when it comes to image galleries and sliders, as it is one of the hottest trends in web design. Creating a fully responsive website only consisting of text and basic images is easy enough, but what about image galleries and sliders? Luckily, there are numerous responsive sliders out there, with jQuery plugins, that will do the job. The only limits are your imagination!</p>
